RESEARCH automated_organics =Automated Organics
#this is the kill-monsters-automatically research. So you automatically get a lot of organic material
RESEARCH rehydration        =Rehydration
#this research unlocks a way to duplicate water by putting it in a special cycle. "Rehydration" was the word chosen because it sounds like hydration (water) is going in a cycle
RESEARCH mass_core          =Mass Core
